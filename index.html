photographs, but the memory which you shall treasure forever. You want beautiful photos of one of the most important days of your life that you’ll be celebrating with family and friends!</p><p>I know finding a good candid wedding photographer is one of the most crucial elements of your wedding preparation- as well the most difficult one. However, in this blog post I won’t tell you how to choose your candid wedding photographer instead I would like to tell you reasons <em>why should you choose me as your wedding photographer:</em>–</p><p><strong>Exceeding Your Expectations:</strong> My goal is to exceed your expectations and I really mean it! For a typical two days of the wedding event, I provide 1200 plus high quality images. Even my most of the images are well exposed; I take time to review all the images and edit to ensure you get the best output. I usually go to the wedding venue in advance to better understand the various possibilities and vantage points for getting the best photographs. On the big day, I also start my photographing for the day much before the actual event starts to ensure we don’t miss anything. Because a moment of lifetime remembrance can happen any time!</p><p><strong>Affordable yet the best:</strong> I offer a top quality, personalized experience and high quality deliverables at the most compelling rates. Almost the 50% less then what other candid wedding photographers in Bangalore with similar expertise level are charging.</p><p><strong>Experience and Professionalism:</strong> I have more than 24 months of experience as a professional wedding photographer. Participated in many online and offline trainings and equipped myself with the required knowledge to produce the best results for my candid wedding photography clients. Over the years, honed my skill to produce the best results despite usual wedding day`s high pressure situations and constantly changing lighting conditions.</p><p><strong>My style of photography</strong>: Getting relaxed and natural images with beautiful composition is my strength. I know how busy an Indian wedding can be but you don’t worry, I keep you relaxed and laughing.</p><p><strong>Best gears:</strong> I shoot with best recommended equipments for the candid wedding photographer including 5D Mark-III and L-Series lenses and lighting equipments.</p><picture>
