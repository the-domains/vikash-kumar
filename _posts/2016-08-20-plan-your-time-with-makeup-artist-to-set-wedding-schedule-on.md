# **Plan your Time with Makeup Artist to set Wedding Schedule on Course**

While the wedding time is the most awaited period in one's life, it brings with it lots of chaos and panic, especially if things are not scheduled properly.

One of the major aspects of any wedding is the bridal make-up. Every bride wants to look beautiful on her wedding day, for obvious reasons. While the wedding day makeup session is quite an important part of the day, a mis-management or tad delay can lead to various problems.

Usually, bride and makeup artist overshot the time impacting the time of other wedding rituals and related schedules. For examples, the delay can affect your photographer's schedule; they might not adequate get time for couple and bridal photo shoot sessions. **Delay also brings unnecessary hurrying up and chaos which is again not got for photography, especially a portrait session with your wedding photographer.**
